This software is still in an early research phase. Eventually it will be released under the GNU LGPL v2.1 license. For now, we distribute this software under the following (informal) conditions:

1. We hereby license everyone to use this software for the purposes of aiding a human in proving theorems in the Coq proof assistant.
2. At this point, we do _not_ license this software for use in machine learning projects. If you have a machine learning project in mind for which you would like to use this software, feel free to contact us about a possible collaboration.
