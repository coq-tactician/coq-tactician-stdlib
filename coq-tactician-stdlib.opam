description: """
  *** WARNING *** This package will overwrite Coq's standard library files.

  This package recompiles Coq's standard library with Tactician's (`coq-tactician`)
  instrumentation loaded such that Tactician can learn from the library. When you
  install this package, the current `.vo` files of the standard library are backed
  in the folder `user-contrib/Tactician/stdlib-backup`. Then exactly the same `.vo`
  files are installed, except that they also contain Tactician's tactic databases.
  Upon removal of this package, the original files will be placed back.
